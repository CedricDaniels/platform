{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring IO brings together the core Spring APIs into a cohesive platform for modern applications. 

{% endcapture %}

{% capture main_content %}

The Spring IO platform provides domain-specific runtime environments (DSRs) optimized for selected application
types. Spring IO is comprised of the Spring IO Foundation and Spring IO Execution layers. Spring IO is 100% open
source, lean, and modular. You can deploy the parts you need, and only what you need.

#### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'org.springframework:spring-core'
}
