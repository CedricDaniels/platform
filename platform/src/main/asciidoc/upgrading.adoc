Platform.

[[upgrading-gradle]]
== Gradle



=== platform-versions artifact

The `platform-versions` properties artifact has been removed. If you are using the
Platform with Gradle, then you must start using the dependency management plugin and the
Platform's bom instead. See <<getting-started-using-spring-io-platform-gradle>> for more
information.

[[upgrading-dependency-management-removed]]

The following table lists dependency management that has been removed. If you project
uses one of these dependencies, you should configure your own dependency management as
part of the upgrade process.

  Apache Hadoop has been removed from the Platform.
