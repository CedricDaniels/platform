[[upgrading-deprecation]]
== Deprecation

A number of the Platform's components have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
New applications should not use the deprecated components and, to ensure a smooth migration path to
future releases of the Platform, existing applications should be updated.

=== platform-versions artifact

As of Spring IO Platform 1.1, the `platform-versions` properties artifact is deprecated. Maven
users are unaffected by this change. If, however, you're using the Platform with Gradle, then you
should start using the properties file published by `platform-bom` instead:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
	dependencies {
		versionManagement 'io.spring.platform:platform-bom:{platform-version}@properties'
	}
----

=== Codahale metrics

As of Spring IO Platform 1.1, dependency management for four Codahale metrics dependencies is
deprecated. Those dependencies are:

 * `com.codahale.metrics:metrics-core`
 * `com.codahale.metrics:metrics-ganglia`
 * `com.codahale.metrics:metrics-graphite`
 * `com.codahale.metrics:metrics-servlets`

The preferred replacements are:

 * `io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-core`
 * `io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-ganglia`
 * `io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-graphite`
 * `io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-servlets`

=== net.java.dev.rome:rome

As of Spring IO Platform 1.1, the dependency management for `net.java.dev.rome:rome` is deprecated
with `com.rometools:rome` being its preferred replacement.

=== net.java.dev.rome:rome-fetcher

As of Spring IO Platform 1.1, the dependency management for `net.java.dev.rome:rome-fetcher` is
deprecated with `com.rometools:rome-fetcher` being its preferred replacement.

=== net.sf.ehcache:ehcache-core

As of Spring IO Platform 1.1, the dependency management for `net.sf.ehcache:ehcache-core` is
deprecated with `net.sf.ehcache:ehcache` being its preferred replacement.

=== org.apache.cassandra:cassandra-all

As of Spring IO Platform 1.1, the dependency management for `org.apache.cassandra:cassandra-all`
is deprecated.

=== org.apache.tomcat:tomcat7-websocket

As of Spring IO Platform 1.1, the dependency management for `org.apache.tomcat:tomcat7-websocket`
is deprecated. Spring IO Platform 2.0 will move to Tomcat 8 at which time the
`org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-websocket` dependency should be used instead.

=== org.glassfish.tyrus:tyrus-websocket-core

Spring IO Platform 1.1 upgraded to Tyrus 1.3.5 (from 1.2.1) where the `tyrus-websocket-core`
module no longer exists. Dependency management for `org.glassfish.tyrus:tyrus-websocket-core`
remains at version 1.2.1 but it is deprecated and applications should be updated to use the
repackaged 1.3.5 modules instead.

=== org.hibernate.javax.persistence:hibernate-jpa-2.0-api

As of Spring IO Platform 1.1, the dependency management for
`org.hibernate.javax.persistence:hibernate-jpa-2.0-api` is deprecated due to the use of a version
number in its artifact ID. `org.eclipse.persistence:javax.persistence` is its preferred
replacement.

=== org.neo4j:neo4j-graph-collections

As of Spring IO Platform 1.1., the dependency management for `org.neo4j:neo4j-graph-collections`
is deprecated.
