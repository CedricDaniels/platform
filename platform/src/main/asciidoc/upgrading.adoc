[[upgrading-deprecation]]
== Deprecation

As of Spring IO Platform 1.1, the `platform-versions` properties artifact is deprecated. It will
be removed in a future version of the Platform. Maven users are unaffected by this change. If,
however, you're using the Platform with Gradle, then you should start using the properties file
published by `platform-bom` instead:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
	dependencies {
		versionManagement 'io.spring.platform:platform-bom:{platform-version}@properties'
	}
