== Using Spring Framework's WebSocket support with Undertow

This version of Spring IO Platform contains Spring Framework 4.1.2 and Undertow 1.1.0.Final.
Spring Framework's WebSocket support does not work with this version of Undertow. This will be
rectified in Spring Framework 4.1.3 and a subsequent maintenance release of Spring IO Platform.
See https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-12302[SPR-12302] for further details.
