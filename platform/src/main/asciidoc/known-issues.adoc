[[known-issues-guava]]
== Guava

The version of Guava provided by the Platform aligns with the latest version that's
supported by the Spring projects in the Platform. Due to the wide range of Guava
versions, each with backwards incompatible API changes, that are in use throughout the
Java ecosystem this version may not be compatible with all third-party libraries. If
you encounter an incompatibility, you can <<getting-started-overriding-versions,
override the version>> to meet your application's needs using the `guava.version`
property.
